<summary>2020 - Recovery and Adventure</summary>

Kathryn completed her first round of chemotherapy in January. The beginning of the year also coincided with the Covid lockdown period in Boston! While this meant she couldn't see her friends in person as much, she focused on recovering and building up her strength through walking, biking and exercise. She also decided to drive up to her family home in Michigan for a few months, and spend quality time cooking, roasting marshmallows in the backyard, playing board games with the family!

Summer and fall of 2020 was filled with sunshine, the outdoors, adventure and laughter. There were many big milestones: a first hike post surgery in Massachusetts (Mt Tom State Reservation), kayaking in the Charles, picknicking at Spectacle Island, Apple picking in Northborough, camping in Conway, and visiting Maine with her parents. Winter also heralded the joyful arrival of Sadie, her mom's cavapoo!

In May, she recieved the very tough (but not unexpected) news that her cancer had returned. With characteristic determination, she prepared herself for a second round of chemotherapy, radiation and a tough surgery to remove nodules in her lungs, shoulder and hips in July. The surgery was extemely tough mentally and physically, however by November, Kathryn was out doing what she loved best: spending time hiking, smiling and being outdoors.
