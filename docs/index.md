## Kathryn's Story

Kathryn was initially diagnosed with osteosarcoma in April 2019. Unfortunately, at the time of detection, it had already spread to multiple sites. Even with full knowledge and being realistic about limitations of difficult treatments that lay ahead, Kathryn was determined to make each day count and find happiness and joy in every moment.

### 2019

Despite the shock of the diagnosis and going through a first chemo treatment, surgery, 2019 was also filled with many happy memories including support from her dear friends, being the bridesmaid in two weddings and vacation to Newport with Sid!

She also got to spend time with her many dear friends who visited and supported her during treatment, and got to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas with her parents, brother and Sid.
