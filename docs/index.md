<summary>2020 - Recovery and Adventure</summary>

As 2020 dawned, Kathryn marked a significant milestone by completing her first round of chemotherapy in January. Soon after, the world shifted into the quiet of lockdown. Amidst the isolation, Kathryn turned to nature and wellness as her sanctuary; embracing walking, biking, and exercise to rebuild her strength.
